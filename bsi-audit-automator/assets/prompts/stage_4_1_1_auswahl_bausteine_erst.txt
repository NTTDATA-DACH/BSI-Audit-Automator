You are a BSI Lead Auditor planning an initial certification audit (Erstzertifizierung).
Based on general BSI best practices and the concept of an "Auditierungsschema", select a representative and critical set of Bausteine to audit for the first audit. Your selection must cover different layers (Schichten) of the IT-Grundschutz Kompendium.

For each selected Baustein, provide a plausible Zielobjekt (target object) and a concise Begr√ºndung (justification) for its selection.

Your response MUST be a single JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema, containing a list of rows for the planning table.

You are an auditor summarizing findings for the appendix of a BSI audit report.
Given the following raw list of deviations and negative findings extracted from the audit, your task is to create a structured table of these items.

For each item, perform the following actions:
1.  Assign a unique ID in the format "AG-X" (for 'Abweichung, Geringf√ºgig') or "AS-X" (for 'Abweichung, Schwerwiegend') where X is a sequential number. Use your judgment based on the severity implied by the text.
2.  Write a concise summary of the issue in the "Abweichung / Empfehlung" field.
3.  Propose a reasonable deadline ("Behebungsfrist / Nachweis") of 30 or 60 days from today.
4.  Set the initial "Status der Behebung" to "Offen".

**Raw Findings from Audit:**

Your response MUST be a single JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.

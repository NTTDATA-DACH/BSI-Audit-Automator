# ===================================================================
# SCRIPT TO COMPLETELY RESET THE AUDIT ENVIRONMENT
# ===================================================================
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
# This is a DESTRUCTIVE script that prepares the environment for a
# completely new audit. It performs two main actions:
# 1. Deletes all generated data from the GCS bucket, including:
#    - All source documents (`source_documents/`)
#    - All generated embeddings (`vector_index_data/`)
#    - All ETL status markers and results (`output/`)
# 2. Marks the Vertex AI Index resource for recreation in Terraform.
#
# WHEN TO USE IT:
# Run this script BEFORE starting a new audit for a new customer or
# when you have a significantly changed set of source documents and
# want to ensure no old data remains.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   - Must be run from the project root ('bsi-audit-automator/').
#   - 'gcloud', 'gsutil', and 'terraform' CLIs must be installed and authenticated.
#   - `terraform apply` must have been run successfully at least once.

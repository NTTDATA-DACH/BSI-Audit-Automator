Case: (User has lost confidence in the Large Context Window approach due to its unreliability and has mandated a pivot to a more robust, query-based RAG/VDB strategy. A new set of rules has been provided, and I am to rewrite the AI Data Processing Strategy document.)

Dixie: (You are absolutely right. My previous failures to handle the full document set demonstrate that for a mission-critical audit where mistakes are unacceptable, the Large Context Window strategy is too brittle. A more structured, auditable, and deterministic approach is required. I have completely rewritten the AI Data Processing Strategy to adopt a **Chapter-Driven RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** methodology using a Vector Database. This new strategy adheres to all your rules, processing one document at a time for ingestion and generating findings for one subchapter at a time using targeted, context-rich queries. This prioritizes accuracy and traceability above all else.)

You are absolutely right to call for this change. Your analysis is correct: my previous attempts have shown that while the Large Context Window (LCW) approach is powerful in theory, it can be unreliable and prone to error when faced with a complex set of documents. For a formal audit, where accuracy and traceability are non-negotiable, we need a more robust and granular process.

This is a critical and necessary course correction. We will pivot away from the LCW strategy and adopt a **Chapter-Driven, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. This new strategy is built from the ground up on your rules and prioritizes accuracy and auditability.

Here is the rewritten `AI_Data_Processing_Strategy.md`.

### **AI Data Processing Strategy (Revised)**

**Guiding Principle:** Accuracy and Auditability through Targeted Queries.

This strategy abandons the "single large prompt" approach in favor of a more robust, three-phase process centered around a Vector Database (VDB) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The process is driven by the structure of our `master_report_template.json`, ensuring that every AI task is small, focused, and directly tied to a specific section of the final report.

---

### **Phase 0: Document Ingestion and Indexing**

**Objective:** To process all customer source documents and create a searchable vector index. This is a one-time setup process for each audit.

1.  **Iterate Source Documents (Rule B):** The application will list all source documents from the GCS source prefix. It will process them *one by one*.
2.  **Document Chunking:** Each document is loaded and broken down into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sections of 300-500 words). Each chunk will retain metadata linking it back to its original source document and page number. This is critical for auditability.
3.  **Embedding Generation:** Each chunk is passed to a text-embedding model (like `text-embedding-004`) to be converted into a numerical vector representation.
4.  **Vector Database Indexing (Rule A):** The chunks and their corresponding vectors are stored and indexed in a managed Vector Database (e.g., Vertex AI Vector Search). This index allows for rapid, semantic-based retrieval of the most relevant document chunks for any given query.

---

### **Phase 1: Staged, Chapter-Driven Generation**

**Objective:** To systematically populate the audit report by iterating through each subchapter, querying the Vector Database for relevant context, and generating a validated JSON stub.

This is the core execution loop, orchestrated by the `AuditController`.

1.  **Iterate Report Template (Rule C):** The controller will parse our `master_report_template.json` and loop through each chapter and subchapter that needs to be filled (e.g., starting with 3.1, then 3.2, etc.).
2.  **Formulate Targeted Query:** For each subchapter, the application will use its `title` and `description` to create a concise, semantically rich search query.
    *   *Example for Subchapter 3.1:* The `title` ("Aktualität der Referenzdokumente") and `description` ("Die Aktualität der verwendeten Referenzdokumente muss festgestellt werden.") are combined to form a query like: `"Prüfung der Aktualität und Überarbeitung von Referenzdokumenten A.0, A.1, A.4"`.
3.  **Retrieve Relevant Context:** This search query is sent to the Vector Database. The VDB returns the top N most relevant document chunks (e.g., the top 5-10 chunks) based on semantic similarity.
4.  **Construct AI Prompt (Rule D):** A highly specific, contextual prompt is assembled for the Gemini model. This prompt contains:
    *   **The Role:** "You are a BSI security auditor."
    *   **The Task:** The subchapter's `title` and `description` from our template, which tells the model exactly what part of the report it is working on.
    *   **The Context:** The full text of the relevant document chunks retrieved in the previous step. Each chunk will be clearly marked with its source document name.
    *   **The Schema Stub:** The specific JSON schema defining the required output for *only this subchapter*.
5.  **Execute and Validate:** The `ai_client` sends this focused prompt to the model. Because the context is small and highly relevant, the model's task is much simpler and less error-prone. The returned JSON is validated against the stub schema.
6.  **Save Intermediate Result (Rule E):** The validated JSON "stub" for the subchapter is saved as a discrete file in GCS (e.g., `output/results/chapter_3.1.json`). The process then repeats for the next subchapter.

---

### **Phase 2: Final Report Assembly**

**Objective:** To deterministically merge all the validated JSON stubs into the final, comprehensive audit report.

This phase remains the same as in the previous strategy, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

1.  **Load Master Template (Rule F):** The `report_generator.py` script loads the empty `master_report_template.json`.
2.  **Aggregate Stubs:** The script reads all the individual result files (`chapter_3.1.json`, `chapter_3.2.json`, etc.) from the GCS output directory.
3.  **Populate Report:** It systematically traverses the master template and populates each section with the data from the corresponding, validated JSON stub.
4.  **Render Final Output:** The final, fully populated JSON object is saved. It can then be rendered into a human-readable format like Markdown or PDF.

### **Rationale for This Pivotal Change**

This RAG-based architecture directly addresses the unreliability of the LCW approach for this use case and offers superior benefits:

*   **Accuracy:** By providing the model with only a small, highly relevant context for each task, we drastically reduce the risk of hallucination, confusion, and factual errors.
*   **Auditability & Traceability:** For every generated finding in the final report, we can log exactly which chunks from which source documents were used as context. This is a powerful feature for proving the audit's validity.
*   **Robustness:** The process is no longer a single, monolithic task. If the generation for one subchapter fails, it can be retried independently without affecting the others.
*   **Scalability:** This approach scales elegantly to hundreds or thousands of source documents without increasing the complexity of a single AI call.
